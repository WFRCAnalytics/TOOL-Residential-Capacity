# TOOL-Residential-Capacity

This GIS-based tool projects potential development capacity on private, non-protected parcels within defined development areas. It assigns development characteristics based on market expectations and simulates growth to a maximum build-out scenario. This helps planners understand how much new housing and employment space could reasonably occur under given constraints.
